# HEFRSys
A high-efficiency Facial Recognition system developed for a research project.  

# Details 
HEFRSys is an abbreviation of *High-Efficiency Facial Recognition System*.  Currently, most Facial Recognition models require a massive amount of high-quality data to function at a considerable level, but such ideal datasets are not available to us most of the time.  Therefore, I've worked on a project to develop a Facial Recognition model which performs moderately well despite being trained on realistic data.
